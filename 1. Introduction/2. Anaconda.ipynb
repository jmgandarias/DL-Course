    "## Description\n",
    "\n",
    "Anaconda (https://www.continuum.io/what-is-anaconda) is a package and environment manager built specificaclly for data. Anaconda comes with *conda, Python*, and over 150 specific packages and their dependences. *conda* is a program that we will be using exclusively from the command line. Anaconda comes with *Numpy, Scipy* and *Scikit-learn* compiled with the *MKL library*, speeding up various math operations. \n",
    "\n",
    "Conda is also a virtual envirnment manager (similar to virtualenv and pyenv). Environments allow you to separate and isolate the packages you are using for different projects. It is very useful, for example when dealing with Python 2 and Python 3. You might be working with old code that doesn’t run in Python 3 and new code that doesn’t run in Python 2. Having both installed can lead to a lot of confusion and bugs. It’s much better to have separate environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Installing\n",
    "\n",
    "You can install Anaconda from (https://www.continuum.io/downloads). Anaconda install these three applications:\n",
    "- **Anaconda Nsvigator:** a GUI for managing yout environments and packages\n",
    "- **Anaconda Prompt:** a terminal where you can use the command line interface to manage your environments and packages\n",
    "- **Spyder:** an IDE geared toward scientific development\n",
    "\n",
    "After that is useful to avoid errors later to update the packages in the default environment. Open the **Anaconda Prompt** and run the following commands:\n",
    "\n",
    "- *conda upgrade conda*  \n",
    "- *conda upgrade --all*"

    "\n",

    "- *conda remove package_name* (Example: conda remove numpy)\n",
