# Deep-Learning-Nanodegree

This repo coontains material about my own experience in the *Udacity Deep Learning Foundation Nanodegree Program* (https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree-foundation--nd101)

The course is structured in 5 parts:  
   1) Introductions
   2) Neural Networks
   3) Convolutional Neural Networks
   4) Recurrent Neural Networks
   5) Generative Adversarial Networks
   5\*) Aditional material 
   
The course also has the following 5 projects:
   1) Your first Neural Network
   2) Image Classification
   3) Generate TV Scripts
   4) Translation project
   5) Generate faces

In this repo you will find 11 subfolders, one for each part/project of the course. Each folder contains related material, notebooks and programs for the respective part/project and also has a *Readme.md* file with main information and the structure of this part/project.
